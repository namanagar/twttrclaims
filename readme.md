## About

Tech & Check Alerts is an automated service that helps fact-checkers find claims to check. Using the ClaimBuster tool — an algorithm that scores sentences based on how checkable they are — we've collected several politicians' tweets and scored and saved them here. This database of claims from Twitter includes all claims previously sent through our email alert program and more.
